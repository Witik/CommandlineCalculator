%% The purpose of this assignment is to apply automated testing and
%% Model-Based Testing (MBT) to your System Under Test (SUT). The
%% first step will be to automatically execute the manual test cases
%% that you developed in the first assignment. In the second step you
%% will apply the MBT tool TorXakis. Try to combine both parts as much
%% as possible, i.e., automate your test-execution in part 1 in such a
%% way, that you can reuse large parts of it for MBT in part 2.

\section{Automated Test Execution}
%% Automate the execution of your manually developed test cases:

In our previous assignment we developed the following use cases

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llr}
Category & Input & Expected Output\\
\hline
Exiting & \texttt{exit} & Nothing\\
Function Assignment & \texttt{f(x):= x + 1 ; f(7)} & \texttt{8}\\
Builtin Functions (1) & \texttt{sqrt(ln(log(100)))} & \texttt{0.83}\\
Builtin Functions (2) & \texttt{floor(0.5) + ceil(0.5) + round(0.5)} & \texttt{2}\\
Variable Assignment & \texttt{k = 3 ; k} & \texttt{3}\\
Builtin Variables & \texttt{e * pi} & \texttt{8.5397342226735656}\\
Expression (1) & \texttt{(((0 + 1) * 2) - 3) / 4} & \texttt{-0.2500000000000000}\\
Expression (2) & \texttt{1 / 0} & Error\\
Equality (1) & \texttt{3 = 3} & \texttt{0}\\
Equality (2) & \texttt{2 = 1} & \texttt{1}\\
Equality (3) & \texttt{2 = 3} & \texttt{-1}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Describe, design, and develop an automated test execution environment for your SUT.}
%% You may use any additional (test) tools that you think are useful,
%% e.g., search the Web for test execution tools, such as Selenium,
%% JuBuLa, scripting languages, a protocol sniffer, . . .

Our SUT is deterministic so for any given input we can expect the
same output. As such we can simply test each use case by supplying
input for each test case and seeing if the output matches.

For each use case we create 3 files with the post fixes
``\_{}input.txt'' ``\_{}output.txt'' and ``\_{}errors.txt''. The first
is the input we give the SUT, the other two being the expected
outputs. These are split in two since UNIX shells output to both
STDOUT (normal output) and STDERR(errors). Some of our use cases
except the SUT to throw error output so this is included.

For the actual test we have written a simple bash script that.

\begin{itemize}
\item For each test pipes the input into our SUT and writes the output and errors to a file
\item Compares the outputs with the expected output using the ``diff'' command
\item If the outputs match simply echo ``[OK]''
\item If the outputs don't match, show a diff of the outputs outlining what was different.
\end{itemize}

The SUT passes all tests if all test cases return ``[OK][OK]''

\subsection{Implement the test cases that you developed for manual testing, as scripts, programs, text files, . . . , so that they can be executed with your test execution environment.}

The full code, including the use cases can be found at \url{https://github.com/Witik/CommandlineCalculator}
%% TODO: make code fit page

\subsection{Test your SUT with the automated test scripts and analyze the results.}

This is the final output of our test script

\begin{verbatim}
exit:                 [OK][OK]
function_assignment:  [OK][OK]
builtin_function1:    [OK][OK]
builtin_function2:    [OK][OK]
variable_assignment:  [OK][OK]
builtin_variables:    [OK][OK]
expression1:          [OK][OK]
expression2:          [OK][OK]
equality1:            [OK][OK]
equality2:            [OK][OK]
equality3:            [OK][OK]
\end{verbatim}

The result is unsurprising, each test is successful. Since we had
previously defined all use cases in detail making correct tests turned out to be easy.

\subsection{Evaluate your automated test execution environment.}

Since we had previously made very concrete test cases and our program
can be communicated with from the command line automation was easy.
Once our script could test the first use case, the remaining ten use
cases could be added to the test suite in a matter minutes.

The testing suite was kept simple, allowing to to be developed in a
lunch break. It would most likely have taken longer to look for a
tool, learn it and set it up. The full testing environment could be
setup in a fraction of the time it took us to get TorXakis working.

Furthermore because of its simplicity it was trivial to add use cases.
Which means that if our SUT would later gain more features we could
easily add more use cases to test for.


\section{Model-Based Testing}
%% Use the MBT tool TorXakis
%% (http://www.cs.ru.nl/personal/tretmans/TorXakis/) to model and test
%% your SUT:

\subsection{Modeling Investigation}
We wanted to model the use cases we made in the previous assignment. Here they are again:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{llr}
		Category & Input & Expected Output\\
		\hline
		Exiting & \texttt{exit} & Nothing\\
		Function Assignment & \texttt{f(x):= x + 1 ; f(7)} & \texttt{8}\\
		Builtin Functions (1) & \texttt{sqrt(ln(log(100)))} & \texttt{0.83}\\
		Builtin Functions (2) & \texttt{floor(0.5) + ceil(0.5) + round(0.5)} & \texttt{2}\\
		Variable Assignment & \texttt{k = 3 ; k} & \texttt{3}\\
		Builtin Variables & \texttt{e * pi} & \texttt{8.5397342226735656}\\
		Expression (1) & \texttt{(((0 + 1) * 2) - 3) / 4} & \texttt{-0.2500000000000000}\\
		Expression (2) & \texttt{1 / 0} & Error\\
		Equality (1) & \texttt{3 = 3} & \texttt{0}\\
		Equality (2) & \texttt{2 = 1} & \texttt{1}\\
		Equality (3) & \texttt{2 = 3} & \texttt{-1}\\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Here the category column is key. The input and expected output for these use cases are deterministic, and are therefore not useful.

Since TorXakis does not have floats, our model will not test for this. This means that no Builtin Function is tested, since they only make sense when using floats. We will not use Builtin Variables in expressions, since all Builtin Variables are floats too. But we do test if the Builtin Variables are defined correctly, by calling them without other operators.



%% Investigate and study (the behavior of) your SUT; investigate and argue which parts of your SUT, which interfaces, and which functionality might be tested with TorXakis.

\subsection{MBT Modeling}
%% Make a model for your SUT in the TorXakis modeling language txs.}
%% Explain your model (structure, processes, data definitions, . . . ).
Our model is named \begin{verbatim} _text.txs \end{verbatim}. At every input step an action is given to the SUT. Here TorXakis chooses from the list of following actions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[Expression] Expressions can be generated out of any combination of +,-,* and numbers. It is checked that the SUT returns the right solution to this expression.
	\item[1/0] TorXakis checks if the SUT really gives an error when presented with this input.
	\item[equality] Our model generates two expressions and asks the SUT if the first is greater, equal or smaller than the second. It then checks if the answer given back is correct.
	\item[exit] This tests that giving the 'exit' commando to the SUT returns 'bye!' and that the SUT does not respond to input afterwards.
	\item[pi] Checks if the definition of pi is 3.141592653589793
	\item[e] Checks if the definition of e is 2.718281828459045
	\item[function definition] Generates one of three premade functions and remembers it.
	\item[function application] There are two options. Either the function has already been defined or not. If the function is defined, TorXakis checks if the SUT gives the right answer. Otherwise it is checked that the SUT gives the corresponding error.
	\item[variable definition] Generates one of three premade variable definitions and remembers it.
	\item[variable application] Checks if the SUT gives the right answer if the variable has already been defined. Otherwise it checks if the SUT gives the corresponding error.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{MBT Test Environment}
%% Develop a test environment or test architecture which will be used for model-based testing of your SUT.}
%% Give a sketch of the test architecture, i.e., the positioning of the
%% SUT, test tool(s), adapter(s), logging tool(s), . . ., and their
%% connections and interfaces; explain your choices. Try to reuse the
%% test-execution automation environment as much as possible.

Out test environment consists or our main Tool,
CommandlineCalculator.jar, TorXakis and a proxy.

\includegraphics[width=6cm]{overview.png}

Our main application, CommandlineCalculator is a command line tool. It
reads from STDIN en outputs to STDOUT and STDERR

SockServ.jar is a proxy between TorXakis and the
CommandlineCalculator. It opens a socket and passes messages through
to the CommandlineCalculator. In addition it simplifies the output,
showing only the final result. This simplified allows us to use a less
verbose model in TorXakis

\subsection{MBT Testing}
%% Use TorXakis to generate tests, and execute them on your SUT.}
%% Explain your observations and analyse the test results.
All tests succeed. If the exit action is executed, following steps are
'quiescence', as should be.

Our SUT passes all generated arithmetic expression tests. Function and
variable assignments are only tested shallowly yet since this would
require a model potentially more complicated than our SUT. Because the
amount of functions and variables is fixed in our TorXakis model all
variations can be tested.

Our SUT passing all of our created tests in TorXakis is expected as
we had previously already tested our system manually and with our bash
script mentioned earlier.

Our SUT is ioco to our TorXakis model. All test cases in our TorXakis
model are successfully implemented in our SUT. However since our SUT can
create infinite amount of variable and expression names the reverse is
not true.

\subsection{Deliverable}
%% Give the models, code, adapters, etc. in such a way that we can run it; provide a ’README’.}
%% Be prepared to give a demo.

The code for both the SUT, the wrapper and the TorXakis models is
publicly available at
\url{https://github.com/Witik/CommandlineCalculator}.

To start the proxy service and SUT simply run the Sockserv.jar with as
arguments the port to run on and command that you would otherwise
execute. If you are in the root directory of the git project you can use the command

\begin{verbatim}
java -jar SockServ.jar 7890 java -jar target/CommandlineCalculator-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
\end{verbatim}

Then run the TorXakis tests with the following command from the TorXakis directory

\begin{verbatim}
cmd.exe /c TorXakis.bat /path/to/git/root/TorXakis models/_test.txs
\end{verbatim}
