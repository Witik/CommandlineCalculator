%% This is the second Model-Based Testing (MBT) assignment of the
%% course Testing Techniques, which continues the previous assignment.
%% The purpose of this assignment is to apply Model-Based Testing
%% (MBT) to your System Under Test (SUT) using a second MBT tool, and
%% to compare. You can freely select any MBT tool; below some ideas
%% are given. Try to reuse as much as possible from what you did in
%% the second assignment, i.e., the test architecture and (the
%% structure of) the model, though you will have to express your model
%% in another syntax, of course.

\section{Model-Based Testing}

\subsection{MBT Tool Selection}
%% Search for model-based testing tools, select an MBT tool, and give
%% some arguments why you selected that tool. (See the list of MBT
%% tools below.)

For our tool we have chosen OSMO MBT
TOOL\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mukatee/osmo}}.
This tool seemed to be the most appropriate from the list of tools
given in the assignment desription.
Firstly the tool is free software under the LGPL License. This allows
us to freely use this model. Many existing tools are proprietary,
requiring us to buy a license for continued use.
Secondly the chosen tool, and its tests are written in Java. Our SUT
is also written in Java so integration is easier than it would have
been if our SUT and Testing Tool were written in different languages.

\subsection{MBT Modeling}
%% Make a model for your SUT, or part of your SUT, in the input
%% language of the selected MBT tool. In order to allow comparison, it
%% is easiest if you model the same part as you used in
%% the second assignment (first MBT assignment). Explain your model.
\subsection{MBT Test Environment}
%% Adapt the test environment of the previous assignment, if
%% necessary, for model-based testing with the selected MBT tool.
\subsection{MBT Testing}
%% Use the selected MBT tool to generate tests, and execute them on
%% your SUT. Explain your observations and analyse the test results.
\subsection{Deliverable}
%% Give the models, code, adapters, etc. in such a way that we can run
%% it; provide a ’README’. Be prepared to give a demo.


\section{Comparison}
%% Compare the selected MBT tool of this assignment with TorXakis;
%% consider the following aspects:
\subsection{implementation relation}
Unlike TorXakis, With OSMO we have to manually implement some functionality.

In TorXakis all we have to do is describe states and state
transitions. After that we can run TorXakis and check our model
against our SUT.

In OSMO we have to manually generate some testing functionality. For
instantce TorXakis has support to automatic expression building (from
simpler expressions) while with OSMO we have to write our own
expression building algorithm.

\subsection{support for test input generation as well as output checking}

rng

In Torxakis

\subsection{support for non-determinism}
\subsection{method of test selection}
\subsection{modeling notation: its expressiveness and ease of use}
\subsection{on-line vs. off-line testing, i.e., on-the-fly vs. batch.}

%% Hints - Model-Based Testing Tools There are many MBT tools:
%% academic and commercial (often with 30 days free trial period),
%% using various modeling languages, with abstract models and with
%% models as programs, on-line and off-line, supported and
%% unsupported, serious and less serious, . . .. Have a look at
%% websites like this one:
%% http://robertvbinder.com/open-source-tools-for-model-based-testing
%% or this one:
%% http://mit.bme.hu/~micskeiz/pages/modelbased_testing.html or search
%% on the web, or have a look at this list (underlining is used to
%% indicate a slight preference): AETG, Agatha, Agedis, All4Tec
%% MaTeLo, Autolink, Axini Test Manager, Conformiq Qtronic, Cooper,
%% fMBT, Gast, Gotcha, JTorX, NModel, ParTeG, Phact/The Kit,
%% QuickCheck, Reactis, RT-Tester, SaMsTaG, SeppMed MBTsuite,
%% Smartesting CertifyIt, Spec Explorer, Statemate, STG, TestGen
%% (Stirling), TestGen (INT), TestComposer, TGV, TorX, T-Vec, Uppaal
